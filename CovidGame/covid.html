			In this game, you are walking in a store, during the COVID pandemic! Even though many are getting vaccinated, we must still follow social distancing and masking. You are denoted by a yellow square, and others are denoted by red squares. Use the <strong> up/down </strong> arrows on your keyboard to stay far from others "walking" in the store, and use the <strong> right </strong> arrow to reach the end of the store. Good luck!
